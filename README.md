this is a tool i created to generate html code for my programming tutorials and make my life easier.
now i can create all of my tutorials organised to code text and titles and i dont even need to code
the html for that.

i will include the prototype for it created with js jquery framework. dose the same thing but in the 
browser and without save to file (front end js cant save to file, plus it was only a prototype).

the save file of the tut is a dat file holding all the data needed to re create the tut project
(all the dynamic fields like labels and textareas).

clicking result will generate the end html i will copy and paste to my tutorial website.

personaly this tools have made making tutorials much more easy for me,i put the code and text in the same
softwere interface and dont need to handle html murckup at all.

-----------

as for the java development, i only needed a basic interface to work with.
one for buttons ant the other for the dynamically generated fields.

i used the buttons panel to handle clicks, and created another class for buttons logic.
to separate the logic from display.

to save the files i used my old dat db class. it saves serialized objects like arraylists as dat and reads them.

other then that nothing spacial.
